RMJ to GM:S Converter
===

A simple tool I made for the small but passionate community of "I wanna" game creators. I Wanna Record my Jumps (RMJ) is a tool some use to design spike jumps for their games. It has a nice interface and allows you to iterate quickly. Ultimately though, you have to manually convert your finalized design to Game Maker: Studio (GM:S) to be able to export the game, copying each object by hand, which can be quite tedious. I made this tool to automate this conversion, which will eliminate tedium and allow creators in our community to focus on creating.

Thanks Klazen108 for the Japanese translations.
