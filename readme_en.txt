This is a tool that automates transferring over objects from RMJ and Jtool maps
into GameMaker. I thought that this tool would be very useful for making
needle games, and I was in the mood to make it, so I made it.

Please contact me with any questions, comments, bug reports, feature ideas, or
love notes. My skype name is patrickgh3, and my twitch channel is
twitch.tv/patrickgh3. You can also find the forum thread for this tool at
bit.ly/needle-map-to-gm.
